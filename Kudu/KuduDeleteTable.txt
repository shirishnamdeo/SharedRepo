Dropping a table fro IMPALA

If the table was created as an internal table in Impala, using CREATE TABLE, the standard DROP TABLE syntax drops the 
underlying Kudu table and all its data. 
If the table was created as an external table, using CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE, the mapping between Impala and Kudu is 
dropped, but the Kudu table is left intact, with all its data.
