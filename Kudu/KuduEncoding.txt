Encoding == LOW-OVERHEAD FORM OF COMPRESSION


Each column in a Kudu table can optionally use an encoding, A LOW-OVERHEAD FORM OF COMPRESSION that reduces the size on 
disk, then requires additional CPU cycles to reconstruct the original values during queries. 

Typically, highly compressible data benefits from the reduced I/O to read the data back from disk. 
By default, each column uses the "plain" encoding where the data is stored unchanged.



The encoding keywords that Impala recognizes are:

AUTO_ENCODING: 
	Use the default encoding based on the column type; currently always the same as PLAIN_ENCODING, but subject to 
	change in the future.


PLAIN_ENCODING: 
	Leave the value in its original binary format.


RLE: 
	Compress repeated values (when sorted in primary key order) by including a count.


DICT_ENCODING: 
	When the number of different string values is low, replace the original string with a numeric ID.


BIT_SHUFFLE: 
	Rearrange the bits of the values to efficiently compress sequences of values that are identical or vary only 
	slightly based on primary key order. The resulting encoded data is also compressed with LZ4.


PREFIX_ENCODING: 
	Compress common prefixes in string values; mainly for use internally within Kudu.
